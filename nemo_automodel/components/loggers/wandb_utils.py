    takes the already-resolved ``wandb`` kwargs (project, entity, name, ...) and
    the full run config to record, and falls back to ``default_name`` when no
    run name is given.

    Args:
        wandb_cfg: Keyword args forwarded to ``wandb.init`` (e.g. project, entity, name).
        full_config: The full resolved config to store as the run's ``config``.
        default_name: Run name to use when ``wandb_cfg`` does not set one.

        The initialized ``wandb.Run``.
