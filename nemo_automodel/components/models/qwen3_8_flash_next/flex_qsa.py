"""FlexAttention execution of Qwen3.8-Flash-Next token-indexed sparse GQA.

One code path serves every training layout: dense right-padded batches,
packed (THD) rows, and context parallelism (local queries against gathered
global K/V) all reduce to "each query row attends exactly to its route IDs".
The routes are scattered into a boolean membership table, FlexAttention's
BlockMask skips fully-masked 128x128 tiles, and the kernel avoids materializing
dense attention scores. Rows whose routes are all ``-1`` (padding queries)
produce exactly zero output and zero gradients.
